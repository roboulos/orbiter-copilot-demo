Hey team,

Frontend is 95% done and looks amazing. Need 10 backend endpoints to make it all work for Thursday's demo with Charles. Here's the priority list:

🔴 MUST-HAVE for Demo (Wednesday EOD):

1. Calendar Integration (2 endpoints)
   - POST /calendar/connect - Connect Robert's Google Calendar
   - GET /calendar/events - Fetch upcoming meetings
   ⚠️ Blocked on Mark enabling calendar API access

2. Meeting Prep (1 endpoint)
   - POST /meeting-prep/generate - Generate prep materials
   Takes: master_person_id, meeting_id, context
   Returns: talking_points, openers, landmines, etc.

3. Dispatch Execution (2 endpoints)
   - POST /leverage-loop - Create loop (wire real API, not mock)
   - PATCH /leverage-loop/{id}/dispatch - Submit for execution

4. Process Monitoring (2 endpoints)
   - GET /process/{id}/status - Check progress (for waiting room)
   - POST /process/{id}/cancel - Cancel running process

🟡 NICE-TO-HAVE (Post-demo):
- GET /network/graph-data - Network visualization
- POST /dispatch/describe - Server-side beautified descriptions
- POST /dispatch/detect-intent - Server-side keyword detection

Total: 7 critical, 3 nice-to-have

Full specs with request/response formats in BACKEND-TEAM-MESSAGE.md

Demo is Thursday 9 AM. Without these endpoints we're showing mocks. With them, we're showing real working software.

Current frontend features ready to wire up:
✅ Dispatch confirmation modal
✅ Waiting room UI
✅ Meeting prep card template
✅ Process monitoring UI
✅ Enhanced outcome cards
✅ All visual polish complete
