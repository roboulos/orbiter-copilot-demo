Hey team 👋

Inline interview mode is ready on the frontend. Need backend support to make it work for Thursday demo.

**What's Built (Frontend):**
✅ InlineInterviewCard component - conversational, context-aware, NO blocking modals
✅ 4-stage flow: identify person → clarify outcome → constraints → confirm
✅ Smart examples that change based on person's role and outcome

**What Backend Needs (2-3h work):**
1. Detect exploratory intent ("I want to help someone")
2. Return `interview_card` type instead of text
3. Generate context-aware examples (CEO → investor examples, Engineer → job examples)
4. Track state through 4 stages

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "type": "interview_card",
  "stage": "clarify_outcome",
  "question": "What outcome for Mark Pederson?",
  "examples": [
    "Connect with potential investors",
    "Find co-founder or CTO",
    "Intro to advisors in their space"
  ],
  "helpText": "Mark is a CEO. What would help most?",
  "context": {
    "personName": "Mark Pederson",
    "personId": 1,
    "personTitle": "CEO at Orbiter"
  }
}
```

**Full docs:** 
• BACKEND-TEAM-MESSAGE.md (8KB - quick overview)
• BACKEND-INTERVIEW-INTEGRATION.md (14KB - comprehensive guide)

**Repo:** https://github.com/roboulos/orbiter-copilot-demo
**Commit:** 46e7168

Frontend is 100% ready. Just need backend to return the structured JSON.

LMK if you have questions or want to pair on the implementation.
