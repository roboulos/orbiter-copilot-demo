# Calendar Bug - Executive Summary

**Date:** February 24, 2026  
**Task:** Fix the bug preventing Robert from connecting his email account  
**Source:** Transcript #430 (Mark/Robert Product Sync) - Action Item #1

---

## 🎯 TL;DR

The "bug" isn't a bug - it's **missing backend infrastructure**. Your frontend is complete and working beautifully with mocks. Mark's team needs to build 5 Xano endpoints + configure OAuth before you can connect your real calendar.

**Timeline:** ~2 weeks (by March 10)  
**Ball in court:** Mark's backend team

---

## ✅ What You Can Do RIGHT NOW

### 1. Test the UI (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/robertboulos/.openclaw/workspace/projects/orbiter-copilot-demo
npm run dev
open http://localhost:3000
```

- Click calendar icon in header
- Enter: `robert@snappy.ai`
- Select: Google Calendar
- Click "Connect"
- **Result:** ✅ Connected with 4 mock meetings
- Test disconnect → works perfectly

### 2. Record Demo Video (10 minutes)

Use this script (in QUICK-START-CALENDAR-UPDATED.md):
> "Here's the calendar integration. Using mocks while your team builds OAuth..."
> [Shows full flow]
> "Frontend is complete - just needs the 5 Xano endpoints I documented."

### 3. Forward to Mark's Team (2 minutes)

Send `EMAIL-TO-MARK-CALENDAR.md` to:
- mark@orbiter.io
- charles@orbiter.io
- denis@orbiter.io

Attach: `FOR-MARK-TEAM-CALENDAR.md`

## ⏳ What Mark's Team Needs to Build

**5 Xano Endpoints:**
1. POST /calendar/connect
2. GET /calendar/status
3. GET /calendar/events
4. POST /calendar/disconnect
5. POST /meeting-prep

**Plus:**
- Nylas OAuth setup (Google + Outlook)
- Database schema (2 tables)
- Background sync (cron job)

**Estimate:** 4-5 days dedicated, or 2 weeks part-time

**Full specs:** `FOR-MARK-TEAM-CALENDAR.md` (comprehensive, ready to build)
