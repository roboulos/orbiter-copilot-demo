## Generation Notes:

**For all 4 whiteboards:**
- Physical whiteboard material (glossy white surface)
- Dry-erase marker aesthetic (blue, black, occasional red/green)
- Hand-drawn imperfections (slightly irregular letters, wavy lines)
- Photographed at slight angle (not perfectly straight-on)
- Office environment lighting
- Realistic marker strokes and thickness variation
- Boxes have rounded corners (hand-drawn style)
- Arrows are simple with basic heads
- Text varies in size (titles large, notes small)
- Some smudging or marker imperfections acceptable
- Maintain readability at standard whiteboard size

**Color Usage:**
- **Blue**: Titles, headers, section labels
- **Black**: Body text, details, diagrams
- **Red**: Warnings, important callouts
- **Green**: Mode boxes, highlighting

**Style Consistency:**
- All 4 should feel like they came from the same whiteboard session
- Same marker types and handwriting style
- Similar level of detail and density
- Consistent photo angle and lighting
